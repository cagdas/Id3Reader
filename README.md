ID3Reader
==============
This class helps you to fetch metadata from live Shoutcast stream. I'm using it in my start-up project - radroid.com. 

It opens socket connection to given Shoutcast server with using necessary header such as ICY metadata. After establishing a connection successfully, it starts to read binary data till reaching proper metadata and prepare media title. It has simple usage.

The easiest way of fetching metadata from shoutcast streams. 
Donâ€™t hesitate to make improvement or ask something about this project.
